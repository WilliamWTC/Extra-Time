# Piano
I recreated a javascript piano inspired by my drive to learn how to play the piano.
I play the virtual piano to refresh my mind and be creative.

The site I use: https://virtualpiano.net/

Songs I can play so far include:
- Rihanna - Take a bow
- Kanye West - Runaway
- Carly rae jepsen - Call me maybe
- Jingle bells
- The Godfather theme song
- Yanky doodle ...

I am also constantly learning new tunes and melodies every chance I get.
