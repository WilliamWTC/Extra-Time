- A simple calculator I created (Using Html, Css & JavaScript). It has all the basic math operators.



- To Use:

-> Open Web browser (Preferably Google Chrome).
-> In the searchbar, type in: file:///(file path of the calculator file).
-> for example: file:///Users/username/Downloads/calculator/calculator.html
-> voila, run those numbers! Enjoy :)
