I recreated a simple calculator (Using Html, Css & JavaScript). It has all the basic math operators.



To Use:

- Open Web browser (Preferably Google Chrome).
- In the searchbar, type in: file:///(file path of the calculator file).
- for example: file:///Users/username/Downloads/calculator/calculator.html
- voila, run those numbers! Enjoy :)
